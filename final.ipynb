      "Answer is:   than traditional mail , mainly because of the high cost and time required in a traditional mail campaign for producing the artwork , printing , addressing , and mailing . </Li> <Li> Businesses and organizations who send a high volume of emails can use an ESP ( email service provider ) to gather information about the behavior of the recipients . The insights provided by consumer response to email marketing help businesses and organizations understand and make use of consumer behavior . </Li> <Li> Email provides a cost - effective method to test different marketing content , including visual , creative , marketing copy , and multimedia assets . The data gathered by testing in the email channel can then be used across all channels of marketing campaigns , both print and digital . </Li> <Li> Advertisers can reach substantial numbers of email subscribers who have opted in ( i.e. , consented ) to receive the email . </Li> <Li> Almost half of American Internet users check or send email on a typical day , with emails delivered between 1 am and 5 am local time outperforming those sent at other times in open and click rates . </Li> <Li> Email is popular with digital marketers , rising an estimated 15 % in 2009 to Â£ 292 million in the UK . </Li> <Li> If compared to standard email , direct email marketing produces higher response rate and higher average order value for e-commerce businesses . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Disadvantages </H3> <P> As of mid-2016 email deliverability is still an issue for legitimate marketers . According to the report , legitimate email servers averaged a delivery rate of 73 % in the U.S. ; six percent were filtered as spam , and 22 % were missing . This lags behind other countries : Australia delivers at 90 % , Canada at 89 % , Britain at 88 % , France at 84 % , Germany at 80 % and Brazil at 79 % . </P> <P> Additionally , consumers receive on average circa 90 emails per day . </P> <P> Companies considering the use of an email marketing program must make sure that their program does not violate spam laws such as the United States ' Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act ( CAN - SPAM ) , the European Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 , or their Internet service provider 's acceptable use policy . </P> <H2> Opt - in email advertising </H2> <P> Opt - in email advertising , or permission marketing , is a method of advertising via email whereby the recipient of the advertisement has consented to receive it . This method is one of several developed by marketers to eliminate the disadvantages of email marketing . </P> <P> Opt - in email marketing may evolve into a technology that uses a handshake protocol between the sender and receiver . This system is intended to eventually result in a high degree of satisfaction between consumers and marketers . If opt - in email advertising is used , the material that is emailed to consumers will be `` anticipated '' . It is assumed that the recipient wants to receive it , which makes it unlike unsolicited advertisements sent to the consumer . Ideally , opt - in email advertisements will be more personal and relevant to the consumer than untargeted advertisements . </P> <P> A common example of permission marketing is a newsletter sent to an advertising firm 's customers . Such newsletters inform customers of upcoming events or promotions , or new products . In this type of advertising , a company that wants to send a newsletter to their customers may ask them at the point of purchase if they would like to receive the newsletter . </P> <P> With a foundation of opted - in contact information stored in their database , marketers can send out promotional materials automatically using autoresponders -- known as drip marketing . They can also segment their promotions to specific market segments . </P> <H2> Legal requirements </H2> <H3> Australia </H3> <P> The Australian Spam Act 2003 is enforced by the Australian Communications and Media Authority , widely known as `` ACMA '' . The act defines the term unsolicited electronic messages , states how unsubscribe functions must work for commercial messages , and gives other key information . Fines range with 3 fines of AU $110,000 being issued to Virgin Blue Airlines ( 2011 ) , Tiger Airways Holdings Limited ( 2012 ) and Cellar master Wines Pty Limited ( 2013 ) . </P> <H3> Canada </H3> <P> The `` Canada Anti-Spam Law '' ( CASL ) went into effect on July 1 , 2014 . CASL requires an explicit or implicit opt - in from users , and the maximum fines for noncompliance are CA $ 1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses . </P> <H3> European Union </H3> <P> In 2002 the European Union ( EU ) introduced the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications . Article 13 of the Directive prohibits the use of personal email addresses for marketing purposes . The Directive establishes the opt - in regime , where unsolicited emails may be sent only with prior agreement of the recipient ; this does not apply to business email addresses . </P> <P> The directive has since been incorporated into the laws of member states . In the UK it is covered under the Privacy and Electronic Communications ( EC Directive ) Regulations 2003 and applies to all organizations that send out marketing by some form of electronic communication . </P> <H3> United states </H3> <P> The CAN - SPAM Act of 2003 was\n",
